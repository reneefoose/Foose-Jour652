By Renee A. Foose<br><br>
            As the Millennial generation grows into young and middle adulthood, a new generation has reached college age.  This new generation of students, known as iGen or GenZ, and now freshman, have arrived on college campuses around the nation with aspirations and needs much different than their predecessors.  Several of the differences this cohort brings is their attitude toward diversity, technology, money, and the pursuit of a career that is meaningful.  To this end, colleges will have to change their approach to meet the needs of this generation beginning with recruitment.<br><br>
          	In the past fifteen years, colleges and universities have catered to Millennials by transforming campus’ into inviting spaces, similar to coffee shop gathering spots.  Dormitories have been fashioned to resemble hotel suites and student unions have every amenity imaginable, complete with mall-like food courts.  The payoff for such boutique lures has been minimal.  College tuition has skyrocketed as enrollment dwindles.  Millennials have more college debt than any other generation and is an amount that is only rivaled by the mortgage debt in the United States. In many ways, millennials are still living with the effects of the Great Recession and the aftermath.

      <p class="one">
		Research on GenZ is still emerging but what is clear is this new generation has increased expectations for student success.  This is the first generation that has grown up entirely in the digital age, offten said to be digitally innate.  Presented with iPads and smartphones in elementary school, GenZ views technology as an extension of themselves and they expect a high-tech campus to allow them to freely exchange with friends, professors, and family. They will focus on the personal support they receive to make their educational experience relevant to their future career choice, thus requiring fewer lush campus amenities.

      </div>
      <p class="one" style="margin-top: 20px">
      	Student success for GenZ will require a new approach as well.  This generation is well versed on how to learn in physical and virtual settings.  They see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> as the most effective teachers and the best way to learn information they can apply.  College faculty will have to adapt to creating experiential opportunities where students can work using their own blend of independent and group work; project-based learning activities; and research that will hone crucial marketable skills for life beyond graduation.
      </p>

      <p class="one">
        With 13% of GenZ having already formed their own businesses, they want to apply what they learn according to Steve Kozinsky at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/">Forbes</a>.  A challenge for college faculty will be how students want to learn.  More than one third of teens reported not reading a book in the last year for pleasure and more than half said they have no interest in reading a book at all.  This generation is laser focused on relevance, needing to see value in assignments and activities, they will not hesitate to ask "Do I need to know this?"  Does this affect me?" Why should I care about this?"  This will be a challenge for professors that assign hundreds of pages of reading weekly.

        <h1 class="titleh">GenZ Moral Positioning</h1>
        <p class="one">
			Above all else, GenZ wants inclusive settings.  This is the most diverse generation in history and they are paying attention to inclusion, not only of race, ethnicity, gender, and orientation, but to approaches on well-being and mental health. This approach to inclusivity has a trade-off.  GenZ, having grown up being mindful of bullying in middle and high school, are quick to organize to stop any speech that is against their belief system.  They are not open to differing points of view and are quick to categorize free speech as oppressive if falls outside of thier beliefs.

        </div>

        <p class="one" style="margin-top: 20px">
			GenZ is skeptical of free speech, most noted when speech offends or runs counter to their view of tolerance.
			Take for instance the campus response at <a href="https://www.towson.edu/">Towson University</a> in Maryland. A group of students <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-county/towson/ph-tt-towson-protest-0418-story.html">protesting LGBT</a> rights were met with throngs of students intending to drive the protesters off campus.

        </div>
        <p class="one" style="margin-top: 20px">
			At <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> in Illinois, student protesters shut down a class after a professor invited  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to speak to her sociology class.<a href="http://time.com/4783252/northwestern-sociology-class-ice-protest/"> TIME reported</a> protesters took a position against the officer’s presence following national efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. Similar protests have occurred throughout the nation in the past year putting college presidents and professors on edge.

        </div>
        <p class="one" style="margin-top: 20px">
			Offensive speech and moral positioning are not the only causes GenZ will protest.  After 50 years of not having protests,<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/">CNN</a> reported <a href="https://home.howard.edu/">Howard University</a> students protested for greater financial transparency after audits revealed <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/29/us/protests-financial-aid-scandal-howard-university/index.html">budget mismanagement</a> by university administration.  After days of not attending class and having 24-hour sit-ins, the students demanded more financial aid, transparency of university financials, and the resignation of the univeristy president.  Campus leaders and Howard alumni negotiated with students offering more financial aid and transparency.

        <h1 class="titleh">The Early Bird Gets the Prize</h1>
        <p class="one">

			University officials will have to shift gears quickly to recruit and retain students in GenZ.  In the wake of marketing to Millennials, facility growth on campus has exploded and now outpaces revenue projections.  GenZ, being both pragmatic and pessimistic, are fewer in numbers than their predecessors.   Strategic campus leaders that are adept at marketing directly to this generation, while growing a faculty focused on personalizing the student experience and willing to mentor beyond graduation, will be better positioned to compete for young applicants.  Additionally, faster transitions to meet the needs of this generation will allow campus officials to rededicate funding streams, once used for Millennial perks, back into course offerings, student services,  educational outcomes, and well-being centers GenZ is fixated on.

  	  </div>

      <p class="one">
      	Colleges that are deliberate about messaging the value of their degree will have an advantage in the early market for GenZ enrollment.  In a 2018 Harris poll conducted in cooperation with Pearson Education, researchers asked 2,500 students about their attitude toward the goal of college.  More than half (57%) of GenZ students said the goal of college is to prepare graduating students for a specific career versus life in general.  The data suggests GenZ has increased expectations and demands for a different college experience than generations before them.  A clearly defined path to a career can be very attractive to low-income and minority students.

        <h1 class="titleh">Communicating with GenZ</h1>
        <quote style="margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;font-size: 40px">
        	“<b>Traditional methods of teaching will not keep this generation engaged</b>”
        </quote><br>
        <p class="one">
			Understanding the next generation may be much easier than communicating with them.  When the internet arrived on campus in the mid 1990’s colleges were slow to adopt the web.  A decade later many universities were tardy adopting social media as a means to connect with Millennials.  The new cohort is native to technology and according to the Harris Poll, GenZ prefers Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat over Facebook.  New platforms will emerge to compete with established ones and will certainly capture GenZ’s attention.  With the need for instant gratification through likes and re-tweets, this generation is also known to convey emotion and feeling through emojis and gifs rather than spoken words.  Colleges will have to quickly adapt their social media engagement strategies accordingly and instructors will need to up their game to keep GenZ interested in their classes.

      <p class="one">
        Effective college teachers will need to demonstrate subject matter enthusiasm and relevance to appeal to GenZ.  Traditional methods of teaching will not keep this generation engaged in the learning process.  Rather, instructors modeling their teaching to the internet-of-things and using a blend of traditional and digital approaches will be the most appealing to GenZ.  This generation will want the classroom and the teacher to be smart, knowing their learning preferences and delivering with personalization.   Like Millennials, this generation will thrive with a combination of independent and collaborative work groups where they can apply concepts and have exposure to experiential learning and internships.<br><br>

		In addition to wanting blended classrooms with animated instructors, Vickie Cook, an associate professor at the University of Illinois suggests instructors allow students to tell their stories using their own tools such as podcasts, blogs, or video games.  She also suggests creating flexible learning spaces that can accommodate both group and individual work spaces for students.<br><br>

		Taking lessons from their Millennial sibling’s lack of job prospects after college, GenZ has developed a mindset of build-it-yourself careers and they want to develop the skills to make that happen.<br><br>

        <h1 class="titleh" style="margin-left: -40px" >Next Steps</h1>
        <p class="one">
            Campus administrators that can take lessons from the past generations of students and design the learning environment to the needs of this incoming cohort will be honor roll worthy.  In addition to creating  personalized and engaging spaces, Gen Z is expecting a strong focus on health and emotional wellness.  Student services on campus will have to evolve  holistic practices that serve more than mental health through traditional counseling.  Gen Z brings with them a strong work ethic and laser focus on their goals.  Stress will not be foreign to them and campus services should have programs to help with stress management.<br><br>

			To meet the needs of this generation administrators should focus on planning.  Rather than developing strategic plans in five- or ten-year cycles, three years would allow for adjustments and realignments.  Listening to this cohort offers campus leaders a change to personalize their experience and creates potential loyal alumni that will help in years to come.  Gen Z will not be the last generation to require colleges to re-tool and re-brand.  So, let’s update the lesson plan and learn from Gen Z how to be agile and progressive.
